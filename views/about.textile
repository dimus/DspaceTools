DSpace Tools application provide extensions to the Open Source data archive 
project DSpace. So far the following is implemented:

# Simplified bulk upload, which converts zip file with data files and a metadata 
file in csv format into DSpace compatible bulk import format.
# Restful API extension with authorization. It uses either 'email + password' 
authorization or 'public key+hashed digest' authorization.
